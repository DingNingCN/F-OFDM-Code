# F-OFDM-Code
This repository contains a full set of codes about F-OFDM Simulation. All the codes are written in Matlab.

We did a simulation about Filtered OFDM and OFDM on MatLab. 

In our codes, we designed the scheme of our simulation based on the LTE standard and we made some revises.

For the channel equalization, we used the MMSE equalizaion.

For the type of channel encoding and decoding, we used the BCH encoding and decoding, and the code rate is 1/3. 

If you simply want to know our work, just run different parts of our main function called "F_OFDM_main.m".

If you want to see the difference between different subbands, you can run another main function "F_OFDM_main_2BER.m".

If you want to plot the PSDs of OFDM and F-OFDM symbols, you can run "PSD_main.m".
